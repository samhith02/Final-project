The web-based Unified Data Search Application System amalgamates data visualization,
data filtering functionalities and comprehensive data search. It provides an advanced
search facility to the users for exploring the datasets through seamless interactive
techniques. The easy-to-use design of this application includes a layout that adjusts well
to the actions of users, with a clear search bar and drop-down sections that make it user friendly for all types of users working on the data.
The search bar is used for query input that dynamically filters the data, driven by the
system's adept interpretation of unique query patterns. Furthermore, filtering options are
provided through thoughtfully integrated dropdowns and search inputs. These interlinked
filters empower users to precisely refine data presentation to align with their preferences.
The application is also compatible and able enough to use any data format including CSV,
TSV, and Excel.
The versatility of the system extends to the generation of insightful trend graphs. These
graphs provide a visual representation of selected data categories, augmenting users
understanding. The customization of graphs is facilitated through a range of filtering
options available on the interface. The user retains control, with the ability to toggle graphs
on and off for optimal presentation, complemented by an easily accessible close button.
